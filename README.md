# Godot Starter Template

Clone the project and add in the version of Godot you require. You can keep store
the executable of the desired Godot build within the directory of the project, so
that you're always working with the right version. Additionally, you won't have
to modify environment paths either. Furthermore, you should be able to work from
any OS or platform.
